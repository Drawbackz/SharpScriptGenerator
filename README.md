# SharpScriptGenerator

Drag a C# project directory onto SharpScriptGenerator.exe to create a "SharpScript" directory containing a Powershell script (SharpScript.ps1) that will compile and run the C# project in memory.

Any library .dll files will need to be in the project folder.

This has been tested with both console and winform projects.
